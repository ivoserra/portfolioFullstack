## Welcome to my portfolio. 

I designed this portfolio from the ground. Its an original idea, with my aesthetics and mood in relation to design in 2022. 
This portfolio was made with React and wants to showcase my projects and all the exercises I found the most relevant in my learning process.
Its a project that its responsive designed with SASS, and explores the Library React with Routes, props, costume user/data Contexts and animations.

One could say its mostly a project about fetching an API, but its an API that I created. 

This project was deployed on Github.

### Dashboard : a cool product for update your projects on the portfolio.

## The Dashboard feature. 
The Dashboard component is fully functional were I update, delete and create new projects on the browser.
This idea came to instigate to learn more and a great excuse to learn more about backend, fetching, sanitize,  dealing with errors, and to create error messages. The dashboard is functional , it was designed for the owner and later I had the idea to have implement logic for a visitor. 

For these component I used Firebase as a container for heavier image/video files.

## Dashboard for visitors
As a visitor you can see what I designed and created. 
Inside the dashboard component there is the option to delete your profile so its really easy.

## Backend
Its a simple Backend.I have build this backend in node, express, mongoDB, express-validators and schemas from mongoose.
